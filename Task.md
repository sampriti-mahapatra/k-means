You are required to use **clustering as a semi-supervised learning approach** to classify images. Specifically, apply **K-Means clustering** to identify a small subset of labelled images, which will then be used to seed the classification process.

## Datasets

1. **Fashion MNIST**  
   - Dataset for which we discussed how to build a **neural network (multi-layer perceptron, MLP)** model in Lecture 21 on 10 April, 2025.

2. **Overhead MNIST**  
   - Dataset for which you can find a standard **neural network (multi-layer perceptron, MLP)** model [here](https://github.com/Overhead-MNIST-link-placeholder).

## Experiment

- In the original MNIST example, the experiment started with **50 clusters**.  
- For these two datasets, **experiment with different (relatively small) values of K** and observe the effect on the performance of the semi-supervised classification.
